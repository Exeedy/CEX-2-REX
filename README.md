REX Is like Testkit FW But a few things dont work properly

Trophy App "Unlock All"                               
Package Installer                         
Set Auto-Time Off to Never or 60 seconds                              
Browser app has no "Playstation.com"                                 
PS Store doesnt show up. (can still be added to app.db or launched with psns:)                              
Both Title Stores.                     
CMA "Copy Savedata Only"
