# CEX-2-REX

REX Is like Testkit FW But a few things dont work properly

Debug Utility                                      
Trophy App "Unlock All"                               
Package Installer                         
Set Auto-Time Off to Never or 60 seconds                              
Browser app has no "Playstation.com"                                 
PS Store doesnt show up. (can still be added to app.db or launched with psns:)                              
Both Title Stores.                     
CMA "Copy Savedata Only"                               

What doesnt work:

MiniSettingsForQA            
Debug Settings            
Downgrading

Executing Unsigned Code.

BUT HOW DO I REMOVE IT?
By reinstalling your firmware. dont worry, you wont loose any files on your memory card or anything. its just like a system update only your updating from 3.60 to 3.60 there are a bunch of ways to do this but the easiest way is to use the Firwmare-Reinstall app https://github.com/SilicaAndPina/Firmware-Reinstall/releases
